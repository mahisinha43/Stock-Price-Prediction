# Stock-Price-Prediction

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on predicting the opening and closing prices of Tata Motors stock using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to assess the effectiveness of two regression models.

 Firstly, I utilized the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict stock prices. SVM is a powerful method that is capable of learning complex patterns in data. Furthermore, I used Random Forest to make the prediction. 
In addition, I compared the accuracy of both algorithms using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared coefficient.
